# Abstract

How effective would Chinese satellite reconnaissance be against U.S. surface ships during a war? How much counter-space intervention would be required by the United States to reduce risk to acceptable levels? These questions are important because they inform us about the plausible course of events in a Sino-U.S. war and are critical in shaping U.S. shipbuilding policy. To answer these questions with more contemporary information and at higher fidelity, we designed a simulation of Chinese earth-observation satellites and tested it under a range of scenarios. We find that most U.S. ships would likely be detected and identified within an hour within the second island chain. We also find that [75%] of Chinese earth-observation satellites would have to be eliminated in order to reduce the median time to identification to a day. This implies 1) that U.S. surface ships will be reliably detected and identified during a war with China, and 2) that there would be high escalatory pressure on the United States to initiate extensive counterspace actions.

# Introduction

How effective would Chinese satellite reconnaissance be against U.S. surface ships during a war? How much counter-space intervention would be required by the United States to reduce risk to acceptable levels? These questions are important because they inform us about the plausible course of events in a Sino-U.S. war and are critical in shaping U.S. shipbuilding policy. Montgomery (2014) argues that Chinese capabilities required a shift away from surface ships.^[Montgomery, Evan Braden. 2014. "Contested Primacy in the Western Pacific: China's Rise and the Future of U.S. Power Projection." International Security 38(4): 115--149. https://doi.org/10.1162/ISEC_a_00160] Unfortunately, most of the scholarly literature builds on research that was conducted before a massive expansion in Chinese earth-observation satellite launches and even then only with estimations, relying on Heginbotham et al. (2015).^[Heginbotham, Eric, Michael Nixon, Forrest E. Morgan, Jacob L. Heim, Jeff Hagen, Sheng Tao Li, Jeffrey Engstrom, Martin C. Libicki, Paul DeLuca, David A. Shlapak, David R. Frelinger, Burgess Laird, Kyle Brady, and Lyle J. Morris. 2015. The U.S.-China Military Scorecard: Forces, Geography, and the Evolving Balance of Power, 1996–2017. RAND Corporation. https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR392.html] To answer these questions with more contemporary information and at higher fidelity, we designed a simulation of Chinese earth-observation satellites and tested it under a range of scenarios. We find that most U.S. ships would likely be detected and identified within an hour within the second island chain. We also find that [75%] of Chinese earth-observation satellites would have to be eliminated in order to reduce the median time to identification to a day. This implies 1) that U.S. surface ships will be reliably detected and identified during a war with China, and 2) that there would be high escalatory pressure on the United States to initiate extensive counterspace actions. To support these findings we proceed in [X] steps:

1. Review the literature about Sino-U.S. conflict and how disagreements about both the effectiveness of and responses to Chinese earth-observation satellites have affected this debate.
2. Develop a model of Chinese earth-observation satellites based on open-source research and analogies to comparable civilian systems.
3. Develop a simulation that can employ this model to determine the detection timelines of U.S. ships at different locations and under different assumptions of the extent of U.S. counterspace efforts.
4. Use this simulation under a variety of assumptions about ship location and counterspace activities, finding that most U.S. ships would be detected and identified within an hour and that 75% of Chinese earth-observation satellites would have to be eliminated to reduce this time to a day.
5. Conclude with the implications of these findings for analysis of Sino-U.S. conflict, for counterspace warfare, and for U.S. military force structure.

# Literature Review

China's rapidly evolving space-based earth observation capabilities have meant that the literature on Sino-U.S. conflict has remained based on outdated information. Alternatively, excessively pessimistic estimates of counterspace have led space to be ignored entirely. This has led to the mischaracterization of the effectiveness of and responses to Chinese earth-observation satellites.

Discussion of Maritime Domain Awareness on non-military targets by Pekkanen et al.^[Saadia M. Pekkanen, John Ravenhill, and Rosemary Foot, Oxford Handbook of the International Relations of Asia (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2022).]

## The Need for Updated Analysis

Much of the literature on China's ability to detect and therefore engage U.S. surface ships is based on Heginbotham et al.^[Eric Heginbotham, Michael Nixon, Forrest E. Morgan, Jacob L. Heim, Jeff Hagen, Sheng Tao Li, Jeffrey Engstrom, Martin C. Libicki, Paul DeLuca, David A. Shlapak, David R. Frelinger, Burgess Laird, Kyle Brady, and Lyle J. Morris, The U.S.-China Military Scorecard: Forces, Geography, and the Evolving Balance of Power, 1996–2017 (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, 2015), https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR392.html.]

Green and Talmadge argue that Chinese over-the-horizon targeting is incapable of reliably locating U.S. surface ships unless China already holds Taiwan.^[Brendan Green and Caitlin Talmadge, "Then What? Assessing the Strategic Implications of Chinese Control of Taiwan," International Security 47, no. 1 (2022): 7-45.] "Yet China's Yaogan imaging constellation continues to be modestly sized: China has kept between nine and twelve operational imaging satellites in orbit during the past decade."^[Green and Talmadge, "Then What?," 29.] They estimate that Chinese earth-observation satellites only image the Philippine Sea "two or perhaps three times a day."^[Green and Talmadge, "Then What?," 29.]

Heginbotham et al.'s analysis is detailed, going through the capabilities of Chinese optical and SAR satellites, the number of satellites, the revisit times, and the size of the search areas.^[Heginbotham et al., "U.S.-China Military Scorecard," 150-165.] They use a variety of sources and factor in considerations ranging from weather to viewing angle. The farthest forward in time that they analyze is 2017, when they estimate China would have 9-12 earth observation satellites, leading to an estimate of a 2.9 day median revisit time without cueing and a 2.6 hour with cueing.^[Heginbotham et al., "U.S.-China Military Scorecard," 162.] Heginbotham et al.'s analysis also assumes that the United States will be able to negate Chinese ISR with strikes on the mainland.^[Heginbotham et al., "U.S.-China Military Scorecard," 164.] Based on this analysis, they conclude that "Although Chinese satellite imaging capabilities are becoming more robust, large maritime search areas would nevertheless make it difficult for PLA commanders to locate targets using these satellites alone."^[Heginbotham et al., "U.S.-China Military Scorecard," 159-160.]

However, the rapid expansion of Chinese military capabilities makes it unwise for scholarship to rely as much as it does on one source without reexamining its assumptions. To quote teh Headquarters, Space Force Intelligence 2024 Space Threat Fact Sheet, "Since the end of 2015, China's on-orbit presence has grown by approximately 550% (+800 satellites). As of March 2024, China had more than 950 satellites in orbit." ^([Space Threat Fact Sheet[^SpaceThreatFact2024], 2024, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/MY87VZPX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J4FMF2XG?page=1)) 

The proliferation of Chinese satellites furthermore calls into question some of the assumptions underlying Heginbotham et al.'s analysis. First, they posit that with accurate prediction of Chinese satellite orbits, U.S. Navy surface ships can plan their routes to avoid detection.^[Heginbotham et al., "U.S.-China Military Scorecard," 164.] Yet this opportunity also is closed off with the proliferation of satellites, particularly if it is unclear which of them are assigned to maritime search. They similarly posit that over-the-horizon radars (and presumably satellite control stations) are "well within the range of Tomahawk cruise missiles."^[Heginbotham et al., "U.S.-China Military Scorecard," 164.] This possibility too has diminished as the range of Chinese anti-ship missiles has expanded. One category of countermeasures that Heginbotham et al. cite that has not diminished is U.S. active and passive counterspace efforts, all the way from jamming to direct ascent weapons. The balance of counterspace efforts therefore deserves additional attention.

## Counterspace

Counterspace, or capabilities that can be used to deceive, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy space systems, must be taken into account for any analysis of space warfare.^[Victoria Samson, Global Counterspace Capabilities: An Open Source Assessment (Washington, D.C.: Secure World Foundation, 2025), xviii.] 

At one extreme is Biddle and Oelrich, who scope their work to deal with only conflicts in which all satellites are destroyed at the outset of the conflict.^[Stephen Biddle and Ivan Oelrich, "Future Warfare in the Western Pacific: Chinese Antiaccess/Area Denial, U.S. AirSea Battle, and Command of the Commons in East Asia," International Security 41 (2016): 7-48, https://doi.org/10.1162/ISEC_a_00249.] They posit that for earth observation satellites, "defense is impractical in the long term if a sophisticated enemy is willing to attack them."^[Biddle and Oelrich, "Future Warfare in the Western Pacific," 25.] There are three key caveats. In the case of the United States and China, they both satisfy the condition of being "sophisticated". Second, the fight must be over the "long term", a term that is not specified. This condition might be ignored, as it could be imagined that direct ascent anti-satellite weapons can presumably be built before conflict and deployed within days of outbreak. However, the third condition is most problematic: At least one side must be willing to resort to direct ascent weapons.

Oelrich, van Hooft, and Biddle argue that ground-based dazzling and jamming will be required by future militaries against proliferated satellites.^[Ivan Oelrich, Paul van Hooft, and Stephen Biddle, "Anti-Satellite Warfare, Proliferated Satellites, and the Future of Space-Based Military Surveillance," Journal of Strategic Studies (2024): 1-24, https://doi.org/10.1080/01402390.2024.2379398.] Focus on proliferated satellites and ground forces, but argue that ASAT is favored in the Satellite vs. ASAT dynamic. 

Burdette argues that U.S. constellations are likely resilient.^[Burdette, Zachary. “The U.S.-China Military Balance in Space.” International Security 49, no. 4 (2025): 71–118. https://doi.org/10.1162/isec_a_00509.] "Some of the article's findings about the practical difficulties of counterspace campaigns that are good news for U.S. resilience against Chinese attacks are also bad news for the United States' ability to deny the military benefits of space to China."^[Burdette, "The U.S.-China Military Balance in Space," 74.]

# Modeling Chinese Earth-Observation Satellites

Just as Burdette (2025) identifies anti-surface warfare as central to the U.S. war effort, anti-surface warfare would be a key mission for China as well.^[Burdette, "The U.S.-China Military Balance in Space," 78.] 

This paper is more scoped, in that it is focused solely on China's anti-surface ship mission (not investigating any terrestrial attacks or counter-air) and focused solely on ISR (ignoring whether the destruction of some satellites affects PNT and communications). PNT can be scoped out because we can safely assume that these weapons are not reliant on PNT, instead relying on terminal guidance to strike ships and INS to track location until they reach their seeker basket. Second, communications can be ignored because the weapons don't have to communicate back to the mainland once launched, and the kill web that orders weapon launch is entirely on the Chinese mainland and operating off of faster, more secure fiber optic cables. With a more restricted scope, this paper is thus free to dive into the necessary details for an operational analysis of China's ability to detect U.S. surface ships using EO satellites.

China needs not only to detect U.S. surface ships, but also to positively identify them. Even in the event of a war between the U.S. and China, there would still be many ships traveling along the coast of China and to neutral countries like Japan and Korea. China will need to positively identify that any ship that is detected is a valid target before launching an attack or a patrol for interception. Therefore, we would like to find out not just how likely a detection is, but how likely an identification is. China has an easier time detecting and identifying emitting ships because they can use electronic intelligence (ELINT) satellites. The radar emissions of military ships are highly unique; however, the U.S. could make decoys to imitate their radars. Thus, ELINT satellites detect emitting ships, but they may or may not positively identify ships. We would want to explore how much of a difference in detection and identification timelines it makes if China needs further identification from SAR/EO satellites after ELINT detections. ELINT satellites won't be effective against non-emitting ships. Civilian ships will either turn off their AIS transponders and radars or try to spoof their AIS. We therefore will assume that ELINT doesn't help in detecting or identifying merchant ships. Military ships might also turn off their radars (although this makes them unable to defend themselves).

"There are three main ways to find ships from space."^[Burdette, "The U.S.-China Military Balance in Space," 80.]
# Simulating Chinese Observation of U.S. Surface Ships

"Given that space operations are a means to an end, analysts should base their judgments about dependence and resilience on the specific military campaigns and political objectives that policymakers ultimately care about supporting."^[Burdette, "The U.S.-China Military Balance in Space," 75.]

"The PLA benefits from 470+ ISR-capable satellites with optical, multispectral, radar, and radio frequency sensors, increasing its ability to detect U.S. aircraft carriers, expeditionary forces, and air wings."^[([Space Threat Fact Sheet, 2024, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/MY87VZPX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J4FMF2XG?page=1))]

One important factor in calculating the detection and identification timelines is the delay between when a satellite initially detects a ship and when a missile arrives at the target. This delay includes the time it takes for the satellite to send the image to a ground station, the time it takes for an analyst to review the image and identify the ship, the time it takes to send targeting information to the launch platform, and the time it takes for the missile to reach the target. ^[Heginbotham et al., "U.S.-China Military Scorecard," 163-164.] This delay can vary depending on several factors, including the location of the ship, the type of missile used, and the speed of communication between different components of the targeting system. For example, if a ship is located far from a Chinese military base or launch platform, it may take longer for a missile to reach it. Similarly, if there are delays in communication between the satellite, ground station, and launch platform, this can also increase the overall delay. In our simulation, we will need to account for this delay when calculating detection and identification timelines. We will assume a range of delays based on different scenarios and analyze how this affects the overall effectiveness of Chinese satellite reconnaissance against U.S. surface ships.

## Sensitivity Analysis

We explore variation according to two variables that capture much uncertain information. First, what percentage of China's Earth Observation satellites are actively assigned to this mission at any one time, and second, how likely it is that a follow-on Optical or SAR satellite will successfully identify a detected ship.

### What Percentage of Chinese Earth Observation Satellites are Active on this Mission?

Two factors would decrease the number of Chinese satellites that were available to detect U.S. surface ships: allocation to other missions, and the loss or degredation of satellites to U.S. counterspace missions.

China has other missions it would like to do. Even if a satellite passes over the correct area, if it is charging its battery because it is off duty cycle, it could not contribute to the detection and identification of U.S. ships. Our base assumption is that [50%] of Chinese earth-observation optical and SAR satellites would be active on this mission during a war against the U.S. Finally, the U.S. could be actively destroying Chinese satellites.

Just as the United States must worry about Chinese counterspace efforts, so too must China contend with U.S. counterspace. In fact, there must be some interference with Chinese space ISR to degrade China's geosynchronous Yaogan-41 satellite (should the mission of that satellite, or any others that follow, indeed be to detect U.S. surface ships).^["In December 2023, China launched the Yaogan-41 remote sensing satellite into geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO). The satellite could allow China to persistently monitor U.S. and allied forces in the region." ([Space Threat Fact Sheet, 2024, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/MY87VZPX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J4FMF2XG?page=1))]. As poined out by Burdette, these GEO satellites are particularly vulnerable to jamming.^[â€œWhereas uplink jammers can attack GEO satellites from wide areas because the satellites have a large footprint and effectively loiter in one spot, having a line of sight to satellites in LEO requires jammers to attack from within a much smaller, constantly shifting footprint.â€ ([Burdette, 2025, p. 112](zotero://select/library/items/AU5SVEMT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y7GN9PRH?page=42))]

### How Likely is it that a Follow-on Optical or SAR Satellite will Successfully Identify a Detected Ship?

There is no guarantee that an optical or SAR satellite will be able to successfully identify a detected ship. The best algorithms get about 90%. However, this is based on the ships being in the frame. It is possible that the ship could have maneuvered erratically or be covered by clouds (for optical satellites). Our base assumption is that [75%] of identification attempts will be successful.
