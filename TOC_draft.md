- How effective would Chinese satellite reconnaissance be against U.S. surface ships during a war?

<!-- [Line 8](file:///home/mattserver/Insync/matthew.cancian%40gmail.com/Google%20Drive/Projects/Satellites_Adnan/draft.md#8) -->
- How much counter-space intervention would be required by the United States to reduce risk to acceptable levels?

<!-- [Line 8](file:///home/mattserver/Insync/matthew.cancian%40gmail.com/Google%20Drive/Projects/Satellites_Adnan/draft.md#8) -->
- These questions are important because they inform us about the plausible course of events in a Sino-U.S. war and are critical in shaping U.S. shipbuilding policy.

<!-- [Line 8](file:///home/mattserver/Insync/matthew.cancian%40gmail.com/Google%20Drive/Projects/Satellites_Adnan/draft.md#8) -->
- To answer these questions with more contemporary information and at higher fidelity, we designed a simulation of Chinese earth-observation satellites and tested it under a range of scenarios.

<!-- [Line 8](file:///home/mattserver/Insync/matthew.cancian%40gmail.com/Google%20Drive/Projects/Satellites_Adnan/draft.md#8) -->
- We find that most U.S. ships would likely be detected and identified within an hour within the second island chain.

<!-- [Line 8](file:///home/mattserver/Insync/matthew.cancian%40gmail.com/Google%20Drive/Projects/Satellites_Adnan/draft.md#8) -->
- We also find that [75%] of Chinese earth-observation satellites would have to be eliminated in order to reduce the median time to identification to a day.

5. " International Security 38(4): 115--149. https://doi.org/10.1162/ISEC_a_00160] Unfortunately, most of the scholarly literature builds on research that was conducted before a massive expansion in Chinese earth-observation satellite launches and even then only with estimations, relying on Heginbotham et al. (2015).^[Heginbotham, Eric, Michael Nixon, Forrest E. Morgan, Jacob L. Heim, Jeff Hagen, Sheng Tao Li, Jeffrey Engstrom, Martin C. Libicki, Paul DeLuca, David A. Shlapak, David R. Frelinger, Burgess Laird, Kyle Brady, and Lyle J. Morris. 2015.

10. This implies 1) that U.S. surface ships will be reliably detected and identified during a war with China, and 2) that there would be high escalatory pressure on the United States to initiate extensive counterspace actions.

<!-- [Line 12](file:///home/mattserver/Insync/matthew.cancian%40gmail.com/Google%20Drive/Projects/Satellites_Adnan/draft.md#12) -->
11. To support these findings we proceed in [X] steps:

<!-- [Line 14](file:///home/mattserver/Insync/matthew.cancian%40gmail.com/Google%20Drive/Projects/Satellites_Adnan/draft.md#14) -->
12. Review the literature about Sino-U.S. conflict and how disagreements about both the effectiveness of and responses to Chinese earth-observation satellites have affected this debate.
2.

<!-- [Line 14](file:///home/mattserver/Insync/matthew.cancian%40gmail.com/Google%20Drive/Projects/Satellites_Adnan/draft.md#14) -->
13. Develop a model of Chinese earth-observation satellites based on open-source research and analogies to comparable civilian systems.
3.

<!-- [Line 14](file:///home/mattserver/Insync/matthew.cancian%40gmail.com/Google%20Drive/Projects/Satellites_Adnan/draft.md#14) -->
14. Develop a simulation that can employ this model to determine the detection timelines of U.S. ships at different locations and under different assumptions of the extent of U.S. counterspace efforts.
4.

<!-- [Line 14](file:///home/mattserver/Insync/matthew.cancian%40gmail.com/Google%20Drive/Projects/Satellites_Adnan/draft.md#14) -->
15. Use this simulation under a variety of assumptions about ship location and counterspace activities, finding that most U.S. ships would be detected and identified within an hour and that 75% of Chinese earth-observation satellites would have to be eliminated to reduce this time to a day.
5.

<!-- [Line 14](file:///home/mattserver/Insync/matthew.cancian%40gmail.com/Google%20Drive/Projects/Satellites_Adnan/draft.md#14) -->
16. Conclude with the implications of these findings for analysis of Sino-U.S. conflict, for counterspace warfare, and for U.S. military force structure.

<!-- [Line 28](file:///home/mattserver/Insync/matthew.cancian%40gmail.com/Google%20Drive/Projects/Satellites_Adnan/draft.md#28) -->
- Much of the literature on China's ability to detect and therefore engage U.S. surface ships is based on Heginbotham et al. (2015).^[Heginbotham, Eric, Michael Nixon, Forrest E. Morgan, Jacob L. Heim, Jeff Hagen, Sheng Tao Li, Jeffrey Engstrom, Martin C. Libicki, Paul DeLuca, David A. Shlapak, David R. Frelinger, Burgess Laird, Kyle Brady, and Lyle J. Morris. 2015.

<!-- [Line 32](file:///home/mattserver/Insync/matthew.cancian%40gmail.com/Google%20Drive/Projects/Satellites_Adnan/draft.md#32) -->
- Heginbotham et al.'s analysis is detailed, going through the capabilities of Chinese optical and SAR satellites, the number of satellites, the revisit times, and the size of the search areas.

<!-- [Line 34](file:///home/mattserver/Insync/matthew.cancian%40gmail.com/Google%20Drive/Projects/Satellites_Adnan/draft.md#34) -->
- However, the rapid expansion of Chinese military capabilities makes it unwise for scholarship to rely as much as it does on one source without reexamining its assumptions.

<!-- [Line 36](file:///home/mattserver/Insync/matthew.cancian%40gmail.com/Google%20Drive/Projects/Satellites_Adnan/draft.md#36) -->
- The proliferation of Chinese satellites furthermore calls into question some of the assumptions underlying Heginbotham et al.'s analysis.
