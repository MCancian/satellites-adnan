## Parts of the Argument
- [Abstract](./draft.md#L8:0-239) `How effective would Chinese satellite reconnaissance be in providing offboard cueing to attack U.S. surface ships during a war? How much counter-space intervention would be required by the United States to reduce risk to acceptable levels?`
- [Abstract](./draft.md#L8:240-398) `These questions are important because they inform us about the plausible course of events in a Sino-U.S. war and are critical in shaping U.S. force structure.`
- [Abstract](./draft.md#L8:399-543) `Most of the scholarly literature builds on projections made before the massive expansion of China's satellite constellations in the past decade.`
- [Abstract](./draft.md#L8:544-735) `To answer these questions with more contemporary information and at higher fidelity, we designed a simulation of Chinese earth-observation satellites and tested it under a range of scenarios.`
- [Offboard cueing](./draft.md#L8:399-485) `Key to this discussion is an assessment of China's ability to provide offboard cueing.`

## Literature Review
- [ ] [Counterspace](./draft.md#L58) - Berge and Hiim - first strike advantage depends on tools

## Key Terms
- [Offboard Cueing](./draft.md#L14:58-161) `or the provision of sufficiently detailed information to find and fix targets from non-firing platforms` - Introduction
