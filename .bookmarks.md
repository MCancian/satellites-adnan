## Todo
- [ ] [Lit Review](./draft.md#L36) - The report shows advances but doesn't aggregate them into operational outcome
- [ ] [Lit Review](./draft.md#L38) - That one purpose of Chinese remote sensing buildup is to detect U.S. deployed forces
- [ ] [Lit Review](./draft.md#L40) - Integrate with discussion of Chinese expansion
- [ ] [Lit Review](./draft.md#L83) - Why we include civilian satellites in our counts of Chinese systems

## Parts of the Argument
- [Abstract](./draft.md#L8:0-239) `How effective would Chinese satellite reconnaissance be in providing offboard cueing to attack U.S. surface ships during a war? How much counter-space intervention would be required by the United States to reduce risk to acceptable levels?`
- [Abstract](./draft.md#L8:240-398) `These questions are important because they inform us about the plausible course of events in a Sino-U.S. war and are critical in shaping U.S. force structure.`
- [Abstract](./draft.md#L8:399-543) `Most of the scholarly literature builds on projections made before the massive expansion of China's satellite constellations in the past decade.`
- [Abstract](./draft.md#L8:544-735) `To answer these questions with more contemporary information and at higher fidelity, we designed a simulation of Chinese earth-observation satellites and tested it under a range of scenarios.`
