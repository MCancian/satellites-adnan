## Themes

### Timing
- [ ] Refine detection vs identification timeline analysis → [draft.md:58](draft.md#L58)

### Aggregation
- [ ] "The opportunities and constraints that characterize individual counterspace attacks are different from counterspace campaigns." ([Burdette, 2025, p. 77](zotero://select/library/items/AU5SVEMT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y7GN9PRH?page=7))
- [ ] Add discussion of sensor fusion across different satellite types

- [ ] Model confidence levels for ship identification
- [ ] Add discussion of false positive/negative rates
- [ ] Include analysis of redundant satellite coverage benefits

### Expansion
- [ ] Extend analysis beyond Second Island Chain
- [ ] Add discussion of global vs regional satellite coverage
- [ ] Include analysis of allied satellite sharing arrangements
- [ ] Model impact of Chinese satellite constellation growth
- [ ] Add discussion of commercial satellite integration
- [ ] Include analysis of space-based vs terrestrial surveillance integration
- [ ] Extend timeframe analysis to 2030-2035 capabilities

### Importance
- [ ] Satellites are "as vulnerable as they are essential."^[Michael Krepon et al., "China's Military Space Strategy: An Exchange," Survival, Vol. 50, No. 1 (2008), pp. 160–161. https://doi.org/10.1080/00396330801899512]
- [ ] Space has become "the American military's Achilles heel."^[Paul Scharre, "The U.S. Military Should Not Be Doubling Down on Space," Defense One, August 1, 2018. https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2018/08/us-military-should-not-be-doublingdown-space/150194/]
- [ ] A "space Pearl Harbor" that would leave the U.S. military "deaf, dumb, blind, and impotent."^[Jim Cooper, "Foreword," in Todd Harrison, Kaitlyn Johnson, and Thomas Roberts, Space Threat Assessment 2019 (Washington, DC: Center for Strategic and International Studies, 2019).]
